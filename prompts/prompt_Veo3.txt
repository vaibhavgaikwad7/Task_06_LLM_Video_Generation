Create a casual street-style interview video outside the Syracuse Dome after a big win.
Two characters: Reporter (interviewer) and Player (a young Syracuse guard).
Tone: lighthearted, funny, authentic.
Add mild background noise (crowd chatter, evening city vibes).
Voices: Reporter = professional but upbeat, Player = youthful, energetic, joking.
Ensure lip-sync matches the lines.

Reporter:
“Big game tonight — you lit it up on both offense and defense. Fans are saying you had the biggest impact out there. How do you feel right now?”

Player:
“Man, I’m feeling great. Anytime we get a win in the Dome, the energy is crazy. The fans bring it every night, so we gotta bring it too.”


Continue the same scene and tone. Keep the same two characters.

Reporter:
“Respect. Now… everybody’s asking, what’s your secret? How do you stay locked in on both ends of the court?”

Player:
“Secret? Pshh… it’s Chipotle bowls and way too much Gatorade. [laughs] But for real, it’s energy. Scoring’s cool, but steals and assists — that’s what really flips a game.”


Continue the same scene and tone. Keep the same two characters.

Reporter:
“I like that. Speaking of flipping games — who’s the funniest guy in the locker room?”

Player:
“Oh that’s easy — our big man. Dude blocks your shot in practice, then roasts you while you’re still salty. Keeps everybody humble.”
